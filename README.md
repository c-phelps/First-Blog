## Purpose of this project/repo
To create a blog site that has a light/dark mode toggle and allows a user to input values for \
user name and title as well as content. The website stores the values as an object in local storage. \
The second page is presented when the user hits the submit button. The user will not be sent to the blog webpage \
if any of the fields are empty. Once the second page loads, the blog webpage will dynamically create and display \
the elements on the page. There is also a footer with links to my github repos and my portfolio in the footer. \
If the user clicks the back button they are returned to the main page where they can add further blog entries.
